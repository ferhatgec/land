<p>welcome gech!<br><br>
    gechland's story is inspired from a science and political fiction novel named as
    Gefertean Union (In Turkish: Gefertliler Birligi). <br><br>

    gechland is 2d story based platformer game. <br><br>
    you can play dice; buy abilities like vision, jump distance, walk speed etc.<br><br>
    you can also interact with most of the characters. <br>
    some characters have trust factor, which is changing the dialogues.<br><br>

    gechland is available for free!
    it has ~2 hours length gameplay.<br>
    if you are not good at playing platformer games or not good at controlling synchronically:<br>
    it's not meant that you can't play but the gameplay the can be a bit longer than that.<br>
    maybe you are speedrunner? game can be end in 10 minutes or shorter?<br><br>

    i made the gechland because to make something in my free time, not wasting it.<br><br>

    it's available for<br>Windows (x64),<br>Linux distributions (x32, x64)<br>

    if you were played the gechland before (lucky guy),

    <br>and loved the game;
    you can support the game via:
    <ul>
        * listening to the soundtrack via major music platforms (like spotify, apple music or youtube music)
        (at least for cashback for paid music distribution hehehe :))
        <br>* sharing it to your friends or making gameplay videos
        <br>* giving feedback etc.
        <br>
    </ul>

    if you were played the gechland before (lucky for you), and don't liked the game;
    you can support the game via:
    <ul>
        <br>* same things applies. it's your thoughts. i respect that.
    </ul>

    config file is placed in one of these directories
    <br>(if you are going to cheat in the game,
    <br>config is stored as plain text .wgsd format.
    <br><i>don't touch the extra_state it can break the game.</i>
    <br>deleting the 'gechland.settings' makes your all game progress lost.
    <br>if you want to play on other device with same progress, copy that file, that's it!)<br>
    <ul>
        for Linux distributions: ~/.local/share/Gechland<br>
        for Windows: %APPDATA%\Gechland<br>
    </ul>
